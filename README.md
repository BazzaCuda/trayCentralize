=====================

trayCentralize is a small app that sits in your system tray.

Each new window that opens will be moved so that it is centralized in the middle of the main screen, horizontally and vertically.

It will do this only once for each new window, so that if you decide to move the window, it will stay put.

If you want trayCentralize to always ignore a particular type of window (e.g. every time Notepad opens), press Ctrl-Shift-F1 in that window and trayCentralize will ignore it forevermore.

(Currently, if you wish to reverse that ban, simply edit the .ini file that trayCentralize creates, and remove the appropriate line.)

The value of trayCentralize can immediately be appreciated by opening windows like the Win-R Run dialog, especially if you have an ultra-wide monitor.

Also, windows like Device Manager, which Windows insists on placing way over to the left, even on a 34" monitor!

Feedback on this app and suggestions for further such system tray utility apps are welcome.

### Keyboard Controls
---------------------

press Ctrl-Shift-F1 in any window that you want trayCentralize to ignore.

This setting will be applied automatically the next time trayCentralize is run.

Updates
=======

v1.1 New menu option added, "Reload INI File": This allows the INI file to be edited while the app is running, to remove a previously-banned window class.
                                               This saves the user from having to close the app, make the changes and then relaunch the app.
